2. Search Method (Manual/Linear)
Definition: A simple way to check if a value exists by checking one by one.
Doesnâ€™t require sorting. Not the most efficient, but easy to understand.


public class LinearSearchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] data = {10, 25, 35, 40, 50};
        int key = 35;
        boolean found = false;

        for (int num : data) {
            if (num == key) {
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (found)
            System.out.println(key + " was found!");
        else
            System.out.println(key + " was not found.");
    }
}
